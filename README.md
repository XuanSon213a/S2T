## Discuss
*What was your motivation?*
- My team's main motivation was to create a tank fighting game that took the inspiration from Tank90 decades ago. When we were young, we were exposed to the game Tank90, but only in offline form through disc game consoles. However, since the game can only be played by one person, we want to develop it into 2 or more players, creating a sense of closeness between players.
