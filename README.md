The destruction of a monster from  shell earns the player a point and tanks reappear after being destroyed. The winner is the players when completed all map.
## Discuss
*What was your motivation?*
- My team's main motivation was to create a tank fighting game that took the inspiration from Tank90 decades ago. When we were young, we were exposed to the game Tank90, but only in offline form through disc game consoles. However, since the game can only be played by one person, we want to develop it into 2 or more players, creating a sense of closeness between players.

*What did you learn?*
* Learn unity and teamwork.
* How to create interface.
* How to use audio function to insert sound and image processing function....

## Technologies
Project is created with:
* Language: Java
* Libary:
```
>>Java swing:
* Java swing components are platform-independent.
* Swing components are lightweight.
* Swing supports pluggable look and feel.
* Swing provides more powerful components such as tables, lists, scrollpanes, colorchooser, tabbedpane etc.
* Swing follows MVC.
>>Java Abstract Window Toolkit
>>Java io: Java I/O or Input/Output in java is used to process input and output in java.
>>Java awt:
* AWT components are platform-dependent
* AWT components are heavyweight.
* AWT doesn't support pluggable look and feel.
* AWT provides less components than Swing.
* AWT doesn't follows MVC(Model View Controller) where model represents data, view represents presentation and controller acts as an interface between model and view.
```
* Framework: 
```
JFrame
JPanel
```
